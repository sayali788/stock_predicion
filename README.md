Stock Price Prediction using LSTM
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to predict stock prices using historical data. The model is built with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) suitable for time-series forecasting. The implementation uses Google stock data ("GOOG") to predict future closing prices based on historical trends.
